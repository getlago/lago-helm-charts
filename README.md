# Lago Helm Chart

Version: 0.3.6
Lago Version : v0.54.2-beta

## Configuration

You can start with a very small configuration.
The only fields required are `frontUrl` and `apiUrl`, since no ingress is managed with this version right now, you have to define the URL your application will be deployed to.
